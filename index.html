            <h2>In The Begining.</h2>
                <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="flex-item-inner"><p>With guitar sales growing an average of 15% over the pandemic and Fender leading the pack at a 30% increase in sales, it’s no wonder the do-it-yourself market exploded. 

                <p>What better way to avoid practicing your guitar than building one?</p>
                
                <p>Since buying my second-hand early 2000s American Std Tele, I’ve been upgrading and switching parts out of it. These initial swap-outs included:</p>
                <div id="inner-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Loller pick-ups (Charlie Christian in the neck and a BS in the bridge.)</li>
                        <li>A Callaham bridge plate with brass saddles (well, that was expensive).</li>
                        <li>A black pickguard.</li>
                        <li>A bone nut.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                    <p>
                    All in all, about 1k’s worth of parts and labour. Not bad, considering I got the guitar for 1k (probably about half its value).</p>
                    
                    <p>But was the upgrade itch scratched? No, it seems I had just scratched the surface of said itch.</p>
                    
                    <p>There was something still calling my name. Something I’ve always wanted, and when the pandemic hit, its voice raised to the point of obsession.</p>
                    
                    <p>What might that be?</p><p>A chambered body.</p><p>The chambering (boring out hollow chambers inside the body) lends itself a dynamically responsive, and warm tone. Great for rounding out the inherent brightness of a Telecaster (already somewhat tamed by my Loller’s). 
                    So, after a lot of forum reading (Thank you, <a href="​​www.tdpri.com">tdpri.com</a>), I chose chambered Walnut for the wood (sort of in the middle in terms of tone brightness) and a Dark Danish oil finish (easy to apply, just beware of spontaneous <a href="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/finishing/spontaneous-combustion-oil-finishes-drape-rags-edge-trash-can-avoid-fire/).">combustion.)</a></p></div>

                <div class="flex-item-inner width-control">
                
                    <p>So, while having the thing in pieces, I figured I’d optimize the wiring and put in a five-way selector switch. That way, I could have two different humbucker configurations, parallel and series.</p><p>In simple terms, I was adding a beefier and louder humbucker. There’s a lot more to it, but that’s how I feel about the results. Here’s some more in-depth reading on the subject if you're <a href="https://www.tdpri.com/threads/wiring-s-h-tele-with-5-way-switch.1068545/">interested.</a><p>
                    As you can see from the pics, everything is insulated with lovely copper tape courtesy of my neighbour and guitar maintenance hobbyist, Chris.</p><p>  I also used the copper tape to ground the pickup pole of the Charlie Christian (the Charlie Christian doesn't have a plate to ground to when configuring for a 5-way switch, so I got creative with some trial and error.)</p>

            <h2>And in the end...</h2>
                
                <p>The final puzzle piece was a delicious roasted maple neck (it actually smells like maple syrup) with a compound radius neck 12-16.</p><p>So, it’s pretty flat in the first place and gets even flatter as you ascend the neck. That makes it fast and easier to bend notes on. I haven't played a neck like this since my high school metal days, and It did take some getting used to, but I love it now. I opted for the medium jumbo stainless steel frets (I’ll save the little bitty pointy frets for when I can afford a vintage Strat, haha).</p>
                <p>
                Here’s a little controversy. I got the neck with a Tusq Earvana nut. You know, the ones supposed to resolve the guitar's inherent intonation problems? Ya, that one, and guess what?</p><p>It works!</p>
                <p>Feel free to argue over the science, the physics, this and that, yadda yadda yadda, and blah blah blah!</p>
                    
                <p>It. Works.</p> 
                    
                <p>I tuned Pipe Organs for 7 years (whatever that’s worth!). My ear is pretty good intonation-wise, but the only way you’ll ever know for yourself is to play one. It’s also not for everybody (a dash of imperfection can go a long way). I get that.</p>
                
                <p>There’s always the old E and G chord test:</p>
                
                <div id="small-inner-list2">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tune your guitar.</li>
                        <li>Play an open E chord.</li>
                        <li>Play an open G chord</li>
                        <li>Ask yourself, are they both in tune?</li>
                        <li>If they are, you have something like an <a href="https://earvana.com/">Earvana nut</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                    <p>Ok, digression over. I think that about covers it.</p><p>Please get at me below in the comments, let me know if you have any questions, and set me straight with any guitar-factoid blasphemy's I may have committed!</p>
